# Line Follow Dashboard

Line following as a service for the Neoracer, on port 8086, with the HSV threshold, the crop band, and the PD steering tuned from trackbars in a browser. The car steers toward the largest patch of a chosen color on the floor in front of it.

This is the oneshot lab's `hsv-p_tuner.py` moved off the car's desktop and onto the web: the same pipeline as the student library's `rc_utils.find_contours` and `get_largest_contour`, a mask view and a color view side by side, and a live trace of the line's position so the follower's stability can be read from a graph instead of by eye.

## Install

On the car:

```
git clone https://github.com/Neobotics-Foundation-Inc/linefollow_dashboard.git
bash linefollow_dashboard/setup.sh
```

setup.sh points neoracer-linefollow.service at this checkout wherever it sits and copies nothing, so the repository can live anywhere the racecar user can read. A first install leaves the service stopped and disabled; start it with `bash setup.sh enable`. Dashboard: `http://<car-ip>:8086`.

Re-running setup.sh updates the unit, keeps the car's tuned linefollow.yaml, and leaves the enable state alone: a running service restarts on the new code, a stopped one stays stopped.

## Service control

Run on the car, from the checkout:

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `bash setup.sh` | install or update the unit; a first install does not start it |
| `bash setup.sh enable` | start now and at every boot |
| `bash setup.sh disable` | stop now and keep off across boots |
| `bash setup.sh restart` | restart; takes port 8086 back first |
| `bash setup.sh remove` | stop, disable, and uninstall the unit; keeps linefollow.yaml |

Enable, restart, and an update of a running service clear port 8086 first. A dashboard left over from an earlier install under a different unit name or directory, or any other service on 8086, is stopped through systemd; a `linefollow.py` started by hand is signalled directly. Without this the new instance would fail to bind and loop on `Restart=on-failure`.

## Pipeline

Frames from `/camera/color` are processed at 20 Hz; the camera's 60 Hz is more than the follower needs and decoding every frame would cost the CPU for nothing.

```
/camera/color --> resize to process_width --> HSV --> inRange(low, high) = mask
                                                         |
                                       rows crop_top..crop_bottom of the mask
                                                         |
                               largest contour with area >= min_area, its center
                                                         |
              offset = (center column - frame center) / (frame center)   -1..+1
                                                         |
         steer    = angle_kp * offset + angle_kd * (offset - last offset)
         throttle = speed * (1 - speed_kp * |offset|)
                                                         |
                                             /drive at 15 Hz
```

`/drive` is published from a timer, not from the camera callback, so the mux never sees a gap. With no contour in the band the last steer and throttle are held, as the lab script does, so a gap in a dashed line does not straighten the wheels. The state box shows how long the line has been lost.

A hue low set above its high wraps through 0, so red, which straddles hue 0 and 179 in OpenCV, is one range rather than two.

## Dashboard

Top row, the two views side by side at the same width, then the state box across the rest:

- Camera view: the color frame after the resize, with the crop band in gold, the winning contour and its center in red, a red tie from the center line to the contour center, and the grey setpoint line down the middle.
- Mask view: black and white, the whole frame, so the threshold can be judged on everything in view rather than only the band. The band is outlined in gold; only what is inside it is searched.
- State box: LINE FOUND (blue) or LINE LOST (red). Hover it for the center's column and row and the contour area, or for how long the line has been lost.

The state box carries the live offset chart under it: the line's position from -1 (left edge) to +1 (right edge) against a dashed setpoint at 0, on a fixed axis so a small wobble looks small. The strip along the bottom is red where the line was lost. Yellow markers land at every parameter change. The chart is drawn from an even sample of the history rather than every frame; the saved csv keeps all of them.

The page shows only names and numbers; every explanation is a tooltip. Hover a view, the chart, a group heading, or a trackbar to read what it does and what range it takes.

Second row, full width, the four trackbar groups in the order they are tuned:

1. HSV threshold: three two-thumb bars, one each for hue, saturation, and value. The hue bar's track is the hue wheel, so the thumbs sit on the color they select.
2. Speed and angle: the constant throttle and the proportional steering gain.
3. Crop band: the top and bottom edges of the band, as fractions of the frame from the top. Move both to look higher or lower on the floor; spread them to take in more of it. `min_area`, the smallest contour that counts as the line, sits here too.
4. Proportional speed and derivative angle: `speed_kp` bleeds throttle off as the line drifts from center, `angle_kd` damps the steering on the change in offset.

Every trackbar applies live while it is dragged; the service coalesces the stream of values into one marker on the chart. Save and Load write and read linefollow.yaml on the car. Reset (top bar) re-reads the yaml. STOP (top bar) sets speed to 0.

Save log snapshots what is on the live chart to LogN.csv, including the steer, the throttle, the measured speed, the lost flag, and the contour's column and area. Load log defaults to the latest save and draws the offset and the steer together, markers and the lost strip included.

## Tuning

With speed at 0 the car sits still and the pipeline still runs, so the first two steps are done parked over the line:

1. Threshold. Narrow the hue bar until only the line is white in the mask, then raise the saturation and value lows until the floor and its highlights drop out. The camera view's red contour should hug the line and nothing else.
2. Band. Put the band where the line is about a car length ahead; lower it if the car reacts late, raise it if the car cuts corners. A taller band averages more of the line and steadies the center at the cost of some lag.
3. Angle. Raise `speed` to a crawl and `angle_kp` until the car follows a curve without falling off it. The chart should settle back to 0 after every bend. A zigzag that grows is too much `angle_kp`.
4. Damping and speed. Add `angle_kd` until the zigzag dies out, then raise `speed`. If the car leaves the line in sharp turns, add `speed_kp` so it slows as the offset grows rather than lowering the constant speed everywhere.

## Parameters

linefollow.yaml, flat, in the order the dashboard shows them:

| Group | Keys | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. HSV | h_low, h_high, s_low, s_high, v_low, v_high | OpenCV ranges: hue 0..179, the rest 0..255; hue wraps when low > high |
| 2. speed and angle | speed, angle_kp | throttle 0..1; steer per unit offset |
| 3. crop band | crop_top, crop_bottom | fractions of the frame height from the top; the service keeps them ordered and at least 0.05 apart |
| 4. P speed, D angle | speed_kp, angle_kd | throttle drop per unit offset; damper on the change in offset |
| detection | min_area, process_width | smallest contour that counts, in pixels at process_width |
| topics and preview | camera_topic, preview_width, preview_quality | `/camera/color` on the latest driver, `/camera` on older cars |

Save rewrites the numbers in place, so the comments in the yaml survive. The values are the ones a lab passes to `rc_utils.find_contours` and `rc_utils.crop`; copy them straight into a student's line follower.

## Known conflicts on the car

Anything else publishing /drive will fight this service at the mux and the car will sit still or stutter:

- The wallfollow, pursuit, eps, and smartfollow dashboards all publish /drive. Stop them before starting this one: `racecar service stop wallfollow`, and the same for the others.
- neoracer-autonomy runs a twist bridge that idles at zero on /drive. Disable it while using linefollow: `sudo systemctl disable --now neoracer-autonomy`
- A leftover Jupyter kernel that ever created a racecar object keeps publishing /drive. Restart the jupyter service to clear them.

Check with: `ros2 topic info -v /drive` (there should be exactly one publisher: linefollow).

The camera is read directly, so the driver's inference node does not need to be running; the camera node does. camlabel reads the same topic and does not publish /drive, so it can run alongside.

## Tests

`tests/test_linefollow.py` drives the subscription callback with synthetic frames, a painted stripe on a grey floor, so no ROS graph and no camera are needed. It covers the hue wrap, the largest-contour selection inside the band, the steering sign, the hold on a lost line, the derivative and proportional-speed terms, the clamps on every parameter, the steering negation on /drive, and the yaml round trip that keeps the comments and the integer keys.

```
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source /home/racecar/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
cd linefollow_dashboard && pytest -q
```

## Safety

The neoracer mux forwards /drive with no software deadman. The transmitter's SWC/SWB switch is the physical autonomy gate. The shipped yaml has speed at 0.0, so the car cannot drive until the slider is raised. The speed command is hard capped at 1.0 in code. STOP in the top bar puts the slider back to 0.

A lost line holds the last command, throttle included. On a track where the line can end, keep `speed` low or be ready on the transmitter.

## Car specifics

This package is calibrated for the Neoracer: JPEG frames on /camera/color, steering sign, speed feedback from /odom, ROS Humble paths. The steering sign was verified physically on the sibling dashboards and is the same here.
